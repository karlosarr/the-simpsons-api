Helen was often partnered with Maude Flanders as they protested against the \"evils\" in Springfield. Her first line was in \"Life on The Fast Lane\" and it was \"Marge? Marge Simpson. You remember me, don't you? I'm Helen Lovejoy the gossipy wife of the Minister.\" Her catchphrase, “Won't somebody please think of the children?\" is used quite often but sometimes, they replace the word \"children\" with a different word like in \"Thanksgiving of Horror\", she says \"The Pilgrims! Won't somebody please think of the Pilgrims?\". Also, in \"Pulpit Friction\", she says \"Why won't somebody blame the children?”.

He played a character that threatened to steal all of the Holiday cheer of the Winter Holidays in the Krusty’s Kristmas On Ice show. When a fight broke out between the basketball team and the show skaters (because the preparations for the upcoming game were ruining the show) Homer took matters to his own hands and fought the Grumple, demanding that he return the Holiday cheer. On Christmas Day, when Gil had all of his stuff stacked in the living room of the Simpsons House, Homer commented that this was a problem. Marge then commented that Homer had a bigger problem outside and pointed at the window. The Grumple was standing outside the house, holding a knife and proclaiming \"Grumpily Grumpily Groo! Your blood will make my stew!\" Homer suspects it was the same Grumple from the Ice Show. Sometime later in the year, while Gil was still mooching off the Simpsons, Homer was at Moe's Tavern and the Grumple attempted to attack again with a broken pool stick. Homer hit him with a beer bottle, knocking him unconscious, suddenly, some sort of green liquid began oozing out of the Grumple's eye, suggesting that it was not a human in a costume, but some sort of strange creature. The Grumple does not return until the following Christmas when the Simpson Family spend it at their condo in Scottsdale, Arizona with Gil, having brought his wife, son and daughter with him. The Grumple proclaims \"Grumpily-grumpily-groo, we're here to share Christmas with you!\" having put his feud with Homer aside as the humans and Grumples began singing Christmas Carols.",

She was seen living in the White House, and later moved into the house across the road from the Simpsons with her husband. She reflected some of her views during her husband's presidency, particularly when Bush Sr. was known for making the remark that \"America needs to be a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons\". Barbara Bush had taken a softer stance to The Simpsons, saying that she would have enjoyed inviting Marge Simpson to a dinner at the White House if it was physically possible. She is shocked that when the Simpsons are touring the White House they feel entitled to go into the private quarters of the presidential family and that they see her in the bathtub. Despite being rightfully annoyed at first, Mrs. Bush softens her tone when she sees the Simpsons are wearing VIP badges. Later, Barbara Bush is much more courteous, making friends with Marge and she gets along quite well with Bart Simpson, despite the fact that Bart is a nuisance to her husband. Both Marge and Barbara are annoyed by the fact their husbands bicker and eventually fight, agreeing that both men act in a pig-headed manner.",

Voiced by Jon Lovitz, Sherman was originally the main character on The Critic, which was created by Simpsons writers Al Jean and Mike Reiss. His character has been described as \"balder than Siskel and fatter than Ebert\". His appearance in \"A Star is Burns\" was a crossover to promote the second season of The Critic, which made its FOX debut on the same day after the episode premiered. The Critic was later canceled.

One stunt had him jumping a pool filled with Great White Sharks, Electric Eels, a school of Piranhas, alligators, and one lion, as well as the water itself containing an element of human blood. Although he got through the stunt itself in one piece, he ended up clumsily falling in while basking in the glory afterward, swimming to the edge only to be pulled back in by a lion, and had to be netted out by paramedics and put on a stretcher, barely surviving. He inspired Bart Simpson to become a daredevil and convinced him personally to jump over Springfield Gorge on a skateboard. After Homer ended up hospitalized after he had inadvertently jumped the gorge in Bart's place in an attempt to stop him (as well as falling down the gorge again due to the ambulance driving into a tree), he ended up being the neighboring patient of Lance Murdock, with Homer bitterly telling him \"You think you've got guts? Try raising my kids!\"",

He appeared in an advert for Duff Beer along with Richard Nixon. \nDuring the Season 6 episode Marge in Chains, Marge is accused of being an accomplice in Kennedy's asassination during trial proceedings surrounding  accusations of shoplifting the Kwiki-Mart. Professor Frink suggests her likeness was spotted \"on the grassy knoll\" 137 - 200 frames prior to Kennedy's fatal asassination in the Zapruder film. \nHomer watched him on TV when he was a boy.\nGrampa found out he was sympathetic to the Nazis and had him beaten up when he overheard him say, \"Ich bin ein Berliner.\"\nHe also appeared in Lisa's dream, where Lisa said that she would see him in Heaven, though he then went to Hell laughing after awkwardly acknowledging Heaven in response. He also may have been the president alluded to by Steve in Secret Nuclear Defense Plan U.S. Govt. Film #1612 due to the monochrome display suggesting a time frame between the late 1940s and early 1960s, although the lack of a mention to a specific time frame for the film does not make this clear. After falling into a nuclear bunker in Gone Boy, Bart watched  the real, non-animated Kennedy First Inauguration Speech and mocked it by sarcastically saying \"Doesn't sound like any President I know.\" He is voiced in exactly the same way as Joe Quimby.",
