There is no item on the menu that does not include seafood, even items that should normally not, such as the bread. The restaurant had an all-you-can-eat buffet, which Homer took advantage of, and nearly bankrupted the restaurant in the process when he ate constantly for hours on end (with one waiter when relaying to McCallister is called in to try and stop Homer that Homer by that point had eaten \"all our shrimp, and two plastic lobsters\" and caused McCallister to claim that Homer was not a human, but rather \"a remorseless eatin' machine\" in irritation) and refused to leave even after the restaurant had been closed. When Captain McCallister got annoyed at Homer for eating all the food, it turned into a court case. Although Homer technically won the court case, McCallister had Homer eat huge amounts of food in front of everyone at the restaurant like a side show attraction as part of an \"out-of-court settlement\".",

The Southern Cracker factory has an enormous room where it stores the salt necessary to make its crackers, as well as an entire silo where it stores salt. Kirk once took his son Milhouse on a tour of the factory. Southern Cracker is adamant about their \"happy family\" appeal, having to fire Kirk when he and Luann divorced (although it is implied that this may have merely been an excuse to do so due to the man who fired him being implied to be Luann's father).",
